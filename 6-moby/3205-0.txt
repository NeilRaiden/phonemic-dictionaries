LEGEND

Each pronunciation vocabulary entry consists of a word or phrase
field followed by a field delimiter of space " " and the
IPA-equivalent field that is coded using the following ASCII symbols
(case is significant).  Spaces between words in the word or phrase or

Moby Pronunciator contains many common names and phrases borrowed from
other languages; special sounds include (case is significant):

"A"  sounds like the "a" in "ami"

Words and Phrases adopted from languages other than English have the
unaccented form of the roman spelling.  For example, "etude" has an
initial accented "e" but is spelled without the accent in the Moby
Pronunciator II database.

Each two-part vocabulary record is delimited from others with CRLF
(ASCII 13/10).

SPECIAL FEATURE OF THIS LEXICON:
several hundred words pronounced differently because of their
part-speech have been distinguished.

For example, the entries:

close/v kl/oU/z  and  close/aj kl/oU/s
(terminal sibilant varies)

or

effect/n '/I/,f/E/kt  and  effect/v ,/I/'f/E/kt
(stress varies)

distinguish those two parts of speech.  (Any word with this
information will terminate with the virgule (slash) in the vocabulary
field, followed by one or more of the following part-of-speech
abbreviations:

n, v, av, aj, interj, followed by the rest of the pronunciation record.

This directory contains a pronunciation dictionaries (cmudict.txt is
the most up-to-date) containing approximately 100k words and their
transcriptions.  We use these dictionaries at CMU in our speech
understanding systems.

The phone set for this dictionary contains 39 phones, which can be
found in phoneset.txt.

Stress is indicated by means of a numeral [012] attached to a vowel:
  0 = no stress
  1 = primary stress
  2 = secondary stress

Alternate transcriptions are identified with a numeral in parentheses as
part of the lexical entry.

We generated this dictionary using the following independent sources:
- a 20k+ general English dictionary, built by hand at CMU
  (extensively proofed and used).
- a 200k+ UCLA-proofed version of the shoup dictionary.
- a 32k subset of the Dragon dictionary.
- a 53k+ dictionary of proper names, synthesiser-generated, unproofed.

All of the above sources were preprocessed and the transcriptions in
the current cmudict.0.1 were selected from the transcriptions in the
sources or a combination thereof.  We have removed some potentially
unreliable transcriptions from this dictionary, including those based
on only one source, and will reintroduce them once we have verified
the transcriptions.
