field followed by a field delimiter of space " " and the
IPA-equivalent field that is coded using the following ASCII symbols

pronunciation field is denoted with underbar "_".</p>

Words and Phrases adopted from languages other than English have the
unaccented form of the roman spelling.  For example, "etude" has an
initial accented "e" but is spelled without the accent in the Moby
Pronunciator II database.

Each two-part vocabulary record is delimited from others with CRLF
(ASCII 13/10).

SPECIAL FEATURE OF THIS LEXICON:
several hundred words pronounced differently because of their
part-speech have been distinguished.

For example, the entries:

close/v kl/oU/z  and  close/aj kl/oU/s
(terminal sibilant varies)

or

effect/n '/I/,f/E/kt  and  effect/v ,/I/'f/E/kt
(stress varies)

distinguish those two parts of speech.  (Any word with this
information will terminate with the virgule (slash) in the vocabulary
field, followed by one or more of the following part-of-speech
abbreviations:

n, v, av, aj, interj, followed by the rest of the pronunciation record.

This directory contains a pronunciation dictionaries (cmudict.txt is
the most up-to-date) containing approximately 100k words and their
transcriptions.  We use these dictionaries at CMU in our speech
understanding systems.

The phone set for this dictionary contains 39 phones, which can be
found in phoneset.txt.

Stress is indicated by means of a numeral [012] attached to a vowel:
0 = no stress
1 = primary stress
2 = secondary stress

Alternate transcriptions are identified with a numeral in parentheses as
part of the lexical entry.
